title: "Recipients' anonymity in multihop ad-hoc networks"
abstract: "Multihop ad-hoc networks have a dynamic topology. Retrieving a route towards a remote peer requires the execution of a recipient lookup, which can publicly reveal sensitive information about him. Within this context, we propose an efficient, practical and scalable solution to guarantee the anonymity of recipients' nodes in ad-hoc networks."
