title: "A lightweight certificateless non-interactive authentication and key exchange protocol for IoT Environments"
abstract: "In order to protect user privacy and provide better access control in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, designing an appropriate two-party authentication and key exchange protocol is a prominent challenge. In this paper, we propose a lightweight certificateless non-interactive authentication and key exchange (CNAKE) protocol for mutual authentication between remote users and smart devices. Based on elliptic curves, our lightweight protocol provides high security performance, realizes non-interactive authentication between the two entities, and effectively reduces communication overhead. Under the random oracle model, the proposed protocol is provably secure based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman and Bilinear Diffie-Hellman hardness assumption. Finally, through a series of experiments and comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate that our scheme is fast and secure."
