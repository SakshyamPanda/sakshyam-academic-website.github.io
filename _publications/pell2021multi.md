title: "Multi-stage threat modelling and security monitoring in 5GCN"
abstract: "The fifth generation of mobile networks (5G) promises a range of new capabilities including higher data rates and more connected users. To support the new capabilities and use cases the 5G Core Network (5GCN) will be dynamic and reconfigurable in nature to deal with demand. It is these improvements which also  introduce  issues  for  traditional  security  monitoring  methods  and  techniques which need to adapt to the new network architecture. The increased data volumes and dynamic network architecture mean an approach is required to focus security monitoring resources where it is most needed and react to network changes in real time. When considering multi-stage threat scenarios a coordinated, centralised approach to security monitoring is required for the early detection of attacks which may affect different parts of the network. Int his  chapter  we  identify  potential  solutions  for  overcoming  these  challenges which begins by identifying the threats to the 5G networks to determine suit-able security monitoring placement in the 5GCN."
