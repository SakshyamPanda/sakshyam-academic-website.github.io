title: "Cyber hygiene methodology for raising cybersecurity and data privacy awareness in healthcare organisations"
abstract: "In this paper we present a structured methodology for improving the cyber hygiene perception and behaviour of personnel in the healthcare sector. The applicability and added value of the proposed CH methodology is demonstrated using real- life survey data collected at 3 European healthcare organisations. Our findings suggest that there are considerable differences with respect to human-oriented cybersecurity and data privacy risks across different organisations and diverse employee groups within the same organisation. By applying the CH methodology, we provide the risk strategies together with the list of recommended human-centric controls for managing a wide range of cybersecurity and data privacy risks related to healthcare employees."
