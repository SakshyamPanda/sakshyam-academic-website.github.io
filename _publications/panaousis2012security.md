title: "Security model for emergency real-time communications in autonomous networks"
abstract: "Towards the proliferation of architectures, tools and applications that have the potential to be used during an emergency rescue mission, we present a framework for emergency real-time communication using autonomous networks, called emergency Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (eMANETs). By eMANETs we refer to networks that are deployed in emergency cases where default telecommunications infrastructure has failed. Our goal is to design a security framework that will secure real-time communications during emergency rescue scenarios. The proposed framework consists of a secure routing protocol, intrusion detection provision and security extension for real-time communications using peer-to-peer overlays. We envisage that the results of this work will aid and serve the needs of any society against any event that threatens serious damage to human welfare or to the environment."
