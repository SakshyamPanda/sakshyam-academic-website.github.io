title: "CUREX: seCUre and pRivate hEalth data eXchange"
abstract: "The Health sector's increasing dependence on digital information and communication infrastructures renders it vulnerable to privacy and cybersecurity threats, especially as the theft of health data has become lucrative for cyber criminals. CUREX comprehensively addresses the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of health data by producing a novel, flexible and scalable situational awareness-oriented platform. It allows a healthcare provider to assess cybersecurity and privacy risks that are exposed to and suggest optimal strategies for addressing these risks with safeguards tailored to each business case and application. CUREX is fully GDPR compliant by design. At its core, a decentralised architecture enhanced by a private blockchain infrastructure ensures the integrity of the data and â€“most importantly- the patient safety. Crucially, CUREX expands beyond technical measures and improves cyber hygiene through training and awareness activities for healthcare personnel. Its validation focuses on highly challenging cases of health data exchange, spanning patient cross-border mobility, remote healthcare, and data exchange for research."
