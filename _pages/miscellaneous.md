## <span style="color:#2979ab;">Teaching</span> 

I teach Information Security to second-year undergraduate students at the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. Specifically, I cover the fundamental concepts of cyber risk assessment, threats, cyber risk management, and security economics in my portion of the module.

To ensure that both my students and I stay current with the latest trends in the cyber domain, I place a strong emphasis on research-informed teaching. I regularly update my teaching materials with the latest insights from industry and the latest literature in the field.

Through this approach, I aim to prepare my students for their future careers in the industry by equipping them with the most up-to-date knowledge and skills. Additionally, my teaching approach also provides my students with a taste of the exciting world of cyber security research, which may inspire them to pursue a PhD.

My teaching experience includes: 
- Information Security, University of Greenwich, Fall Semester, BSc/Year 2 (2019-Present).
- Information Security for Business and Government, University of Surrey, Spring Semester, MSc (2018-2019).
