I am a Professor of Cyber Security at the University of Greenwich, London, UK and head of Cyber Risk research at the [Internet of Things and Security Research Centre](https://www.gre.ac.uk/research/groups/isec). My primary focus in research and teaching revolves around modeling and mitigating cybersecurity and privacy risks through the development of optimal solutions. 

## Research
My research has been published in the top-tier journals such as [TIFS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10206), [TDSC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8858), [IEEE IoT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6488907), [COSE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-security), [DSS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/decision-support-systems), [IEEE TII](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9424) [ACM TIST](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tist), [JISA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-information-security-and-applications), [CSR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computer-science-review) and [IEEE Access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6287639) as well as international conferences such as [AAAI](https://aaai-23.aaai.org), [IEEE DSC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9888143/proceeding), [IEEE SCC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1001209/all-proceedings), [GameSec](https://www.gamesec-conf.org). An extensive list of my publications is [here](publications).

My research has been generously supported by funding from the European Commission (H2020, [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en)), the UK [National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk), and the [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/). An extensive list of research projects that I have acted as P.I. or co-I is [here](projects).
