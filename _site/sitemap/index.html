        <p>
        IEEE 802.11 k is an extension of the IEEE 802.11 specification for radio resource measurements. In an IEEE 802.11 k-enabled wireless LAN, an access point or other network element may request from a client or another access point to monitor and report the load of a channel. We call the latter a channel monitoring station. In this paper we propose a mechanism for a channel monitoring station to efficiently derive accurate values of channel load.We especially focus on optimizing the duration of channel monitoring and thus minimize the impact on applications. Note that such mechanisms are critical for the success of new sharing regimes such as cognitive radio and open spectrum access.

        Securing AODV against wormhole attacks in emergency MANET multimedia communications

        The nature of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) makes them suitable to be utilized in the context of an extreme emergency for all rescue teams. We use the term emergency MANETs (eMANETs) in order to describe Next Generation Networks (NGNs) which are deployed in emergency cases such as forest fires and terrorist attacks. Secure routing in MANETs is critical. Due to the absence of a central authority, intermediate nodes act as routers forwarding packets across a multihop path. A well known attack against the conventional operation of routing protocols such as the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, is the wormhole attack. Secure routing in eMANETs is critical due to the fact that secure multimedia communications should be established among the devices of the recovery workers. In this paper we propose a novel routing mechanism called AODV-Wormhole Attack Detection Reaction AODV-WADR to defend eMANETs against wormhole attacks. Our simulations are carried out using the network simulator ns-2 and they show that AODV-WADR does not introduce high overhead, reducing significantly the amount of packet loss caused by malicious wormhole nodes. These are critical requirements for eMANETs where lightweight security mechanisms should be applied and malicious activities should be circumvented.

        <p>
        In many extreme emergency scenarios, such as natural or manmade disasters, the rescuers may face difficulty using traditional legacy networks due to destruction or collapse of infrastructure in such events or in case of remote disaster locations. The nature of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) makes them suitable to be utilized in the context of an emergency for various rescue teams. However, the security and reliability of the mobile ad hoc based communications can be decisive in the effectiveness and efficiency of rescue missions in extreme emergency cases. Furthermore, these stringent requirements propagate through to upper layers that include transport and application layer. In this paper we propose a framework for handling the P2P overlay serves different purposes and combines different technologies. The general functionalities of the framework are structured and unstructured overlays in MANETs. In addition, we propose a new suite of protocols called PEACE Security Platform (PSP) that can address the key research challenges surrounding fast, reliable and secure MANETs for supporting emergency services in extreme catastrophic events.

        In this article, we investigated, using game theory, the competition in a shared open spectrum between two operators. We proposed a new way of maximization of the network throughput, and we provided new ways toward the provision of fairness. We computed an NE and NBS of an NPG and CPG, respectively. Regarding strategies and the best game to be played, there is no single answer. The best solution depends on the perspective. However, the CPG is more effective in terms of clients' experienced quality of service. Our future work involves experimenting with more than two APs in the shared area and evaluating various quality of service metrics.

        Emergency services and networks are an emerging area of scientific research. During an emergency scenario such as forest fires, earthquakes, tsunamis and terrorist attacks rescuers need to establish communication to coordinate their actions by using smart and lightweight mobile devices. To this end, autonomous networks should be utilised to support the afore communications. Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are a characteristic paradigm of IP-based autonomous networks that can be deployed during critical emergency missions. We propose utilising a peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm when designing application layer communication and data sharing technologies between participants of the MANET. The architecture therefore must allow nodes to send and retrieve data without knowledge of the complexities of the network. To this end we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) architecture which we optimise for use in these situations and prove our theorem to be more efficient in such cases than its current counterpart.

        <p>
        The importance of emergency services has lead to an indispensable need for lightweight technologies that will support emergency rescue missions. Due to their nature and the non-infrastructure characteristics Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are characterised as autonomous networks that have the potential to be exploited when wireless communications should be established in an ad-hoc manner in cases that traditional telecommunications infrastructures such as 3G have failed. A critical issue within the context of MANETs is the routing protocol that has to be followed by the nodes in order to set up communication “bridges” among each other. On the other hand, malicious entities may try to disrupt the conventional functionality of any routing protocol by (i) modifying routing information, (ii) fabricating false routing information and (iii) impersonating other nodes. In this paper we apply the IPSec protocol over well known routing protocols for MANETs and we evaluate their performance along with the lines of choosing an appropriate secure routing mechanism that can be applicable in emergency MANETs (eMANETs). These are MANETs that are established during an emergency scenario to provide communication links among the rescuers. To simulate the mobility of the rescuers during an emergency mission an appropriate mobility model has been utilised and acknowledged.

        <p>
        Contemporary personal computing devices are increasingly required to be portable and mobile enabling user’s wireless access, to wired network infrastructures and services. This approach to mobile computing and communication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent infrastructure is available. There are many situations where these requirements are not fulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and military conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile devices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired networks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the wireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of central administration security issues are different from conventional networks. For the purposes of this article we have used the WMN testbed to enable secure routing in MANETs.The use of cryptography is an efficient proven way of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are not as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is detrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic approaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to provide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of performance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing schemes. Our findings clearly show that the most efficient combination of algorithms used for authentication and encryption are SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm-1) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) respectively. Using this combination over their counterparts will lead to a considerable reduction in processing time and delay on the network, creating an efficient transaction moving towards satisfying resource constraints and security requirements.

        <p>
        WiMAX is a wireless digital communication system based on the IEEE 802.16 standard which provides broadband wireless Internet access at very high rates that is up to 70 Mbps or a data rate of about 3 Mbps within a radius of 30-mile (data rate increases as the distance decreases). With the rapid increase in the wireless broadband use, the need for wireless fixed and mobile metropolitan area networks has ever been increasing. Multimedia communications, including audio and video are highly bandwidth demanding and error sensitive. When the coverage area of the wireless network technology is as high as with WiMAX, security becomes one of the most important issues.WiMAX, both mobile and fixed, has many attractive features such as connection-oriented MAC layer, provision of the Quality-of-Service (QoS) for different applications, efficient mobility and power save mode features. Needless to say, all these attractive features must be protected against malicious activities by security mechanisms.Providing secure multimedia communications by using a broadband wireless technology like WiMAXis likely to be challenging due to time or space overhead that occur. Security mechanisms might increase packet sizes thus delay, jitter and throughput are increased. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of secure video transmission over WiMAX networks under different cryptographic algorithms by using the OPNET simulator. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the security extensions giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios.

        <p>
        Serverless distributed computing, especially Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) have received significant attention from the research community. Peer-to-peer overlay networks have the potential to accommodate largescale, decentralised applications that can be integrated into a MANET architecture to enable peer-to-peer communication among different mobile peers. These overlay architectures must be very resilient and their utilisation, reliability and availability must satisfy the needs of mobile computing. One must also heed the fact that the wireless nature of the medium introduces security vulnerabilities. The aim of the work described in this paper is twofold. First, we describe our peer-to-peer distributed hash table (DHT) architecture entitled Reliable Overlay Based Utilisation of Services and Topology (ROBUST). This is designed to be efficiently applied to MANETs. We additionally propose security extensions to protect the ROBUST signalling messages against malicious activities. We evaluate the ROBUST performance as well as the security extensions under varying levels of mobility and network sizes by building a custom DHT module for the network simulator ns-2. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the extensions giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios.

        <p>
        Towards the proliferation of architectures, tools and applications that have the potential to be used during an emergency rescue mission, we present a framework for emergency real-time communication using autonomous networks, called emergency Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (eMANETs). By eMANETs we refer to networks that are deployed in emergency cases where default telecommunications infrastructure has failed. Our goal is to design a security framework that will secure real-time communications during emergency rescue scenarios. The proposed framework consists of a secure routing protocol, intrusion detection provision and security extension for real-time communications using peer-to-peer overlays. We envisage that the results of this work will aid and serve the needs of any society against any event that threatens serious damage to human welfare or to the environment.

        <p>
        Our modern densely populated cities have created an Achilles heel for public safety services where natural or man-made disasters often result in high casualties. The 2005 London bombings have exposed the inadequacy of current First Responder (FR) communication systems for modern response operations. Additionally, FR organisations presently pay a tariff each time Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) communication technologies are used, rendering current PPDR communication expensive as compared to emerging license-exempt IP-based technologies. Decentralised ubiquitous networking proposes an alternative way of providing innovative secure wireless systems for IP-based, infrastructure independent PPDR communications. The ad-hoc setup capabilities of ubiquitous systems will reduce the cost for emergency response whilst allowing more flexible ways of communicating. Key characteristics of such systems are their ease of deployment and the interoperability across FR teams for national as well as cross border operations. In this paper we discuss how decentralised ubiquitous networking can assist emergency communications.

        <p>
        This work addresses the challenge “how do we make better security decisions?” and it develops techniques to support human decision making and algorithms which enable well-founded cyber security decisions to be made. In this paper we propose a game theoretic model which optimally allocates cyber security resources such as administrators’ time across different tasks. We first model the interactions between an omnipresent attacker and a team of system administrators seen as the defender, and we have derived the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) in such games. We have formulated general-sum games that represent our cyber security environment, and we have proven that the defender’s Nash strategy is also minimax. This result guarantees that independently from the attacker’s strategy the defender’s solution is optimal. We also propose Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an efficient technique to compute approximate equilibria in our games. By implementing and evaluating a minimax solver with SVD, we have thoroughly investigated the improvement that Nash defense introduces compared to other strategies chosen by common sense decision algorithms. Our key finding is that a particular NE, which we call weighted NE, provides the most effective defense strategy. In order to validate this model we have used real-life statistics from Hackmageddon, the Verizon 2013 Data Breach Investigation report, and the Ponemon report of 2011. We finally compare the game theoretic defense method with a method which implements a stochastic optimization algorithm.

        <p>
        In this paper we investigate how to optimally invest in cybersecurity controls. We are particularly interested in examining cases where the organization suffers from an underinvestment problem or inefficient spending on cybersecurity. To this end, we first model the cybersecurity environment of an organization. We then model non-cooperative cybersecurity control-games between the defender which abstracts all defense mechanisms of the organization and the attacker which can exploit different vulnerabilities at different network locations. To implement our methodology we use the SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls and the 2011 CWE/SANS top 25 most dangerous software errors. Based on the profile of an organization, which forms its preferences in terms of indirect costs, its concerns about different kinds of threats and the importance of the assets given their associated risks we derive the Nash Equilibria of a series of control-games. These game solutions are then handled by optimization techniques, in particular multi-objective, multiple choice Knapsack to determine the optimal cybersecurity investment. Our methodology provides security effective and cost efficient solutions especially against commodity attacks. We believe our work can be used to advise security managers on how they should spend an available cybersecurity budget given their organization profile.

        <p>
        Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is expected to be a key feature supported by next generation cellular networks. D2D can extend the cellular coverage allowing users to communicate when telecommunications infrastructure are highly congested or absent. In D2D networks, any message delivery from a source to a destination relies exclusively on intermediate devices. Each device can run different kinds of mobile security software, which offer protection against viruses and other harmful programs by using real-time scanning in every file entering the device. In this paper, we investigate the best D2D network path to deliver a potentially malicious message from a source to a destination. Although our primary objective is to increase security, we also investigate the contribution of energy costs and quality-of-service to the path selection. To this end, we propose the Secure Message Delivery (SMD) protocol, whose main functionality is determined by the solution of the Secure Message Delivery Game (SMDG). This game is played between the defender (i.e., the D2D network) which abstracts all legitimate network devices and the attacker which abstracts any adversary that can inject different malicious messages into the D2D network in order, for instance, to infect a device with malware. Simulation results demonstrate the degree of improvement that SMD introduces as opposed to a shortest path routing protocol. This improvement has been measured in terms of the defender’s expected cost as defined in SMDGs. This cost includes security expected damages, energy consumption incurred due to messages inspection, and the quality-of-service of the D2D message communications.

        Game-theoretic model of incentivizing privacy-aware users to consent to location tracking

        <p>
        Nowadays, mobile users have a vast number of applications and services at their disposal. Each of these might impose some privacy threats on users' "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII). Location privacy is a crucial part of PII, and as such, privacy-aware users wish to maximize it. This privacy can be, for instance, threatened by a company, which collects users' traces and shares them with third parties. To maximize their location privacy, users can decide to get offline so that the company cannot localize their devices. The longer a user stays connected to a network, the more services he might receive, but his location privacy decreases. In this paper, we analyze the trade-off between location privacy, the level of services that a user experiences, and the profit of the company. To this end, we formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian game between the User (follower) and the Company (leader). We present theoretical results characterizing the equilibria of the game. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to model the economically rational decision-making of the service provider (i.e., the Company) in conjunction with the rational decision making of users who wish to protect their location privacy. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we have used real-data from a testbed, and we have also shown that the game-theoretic strategy of the Company outperforms non-strategic methods. Finally, we have considered different User privacy types, and have determined the service level that incentivizes the User to stay connected as long as possible.

        Decision support approaches for cyber security investment

        <p>
        When investing in cyber security resources, information security managers have to follow effective decision-making strategies. We refer to this as the cyber security investment challenge. In this paper, we consider three possible decision support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge. We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation, and a hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity threats. As game theory captures the interaction between the endogenous organisation’s and attackers’ decisions, we consider a 2-person control game between the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of a cyber security control, and a commodity attacker who chooses among different targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g. financial) are combined with a Knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a multi-objective multiple choice Knapsack based strategy. To compare these approaches we built a decision support tool and a case study regarding current government guidelines. The endeavour of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security investment. Going a step further in validating our work, we have shown that our decision support tool provides the same advice with the one advocated by the UK government with regard to the requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks in SMEs.

        <p>
        The volume of banking transaction has increased considerably in the recent years with advancement in financial transactions payment methods. Consequently, the number of fraud cases has also increased, causing billion of dollar losses each year worldwide, although from Literature, there has been substantial work in the domain of fraud detection by both the industry and academia's. Despite the substantial work, there are few researches in applying case-based reasoning (CBR) approach in the context of detecting Financial Fraud. In this paper we aim at evaluating the performance of CBR in Identifying fraudulent patterns among financial transaction by comparing it with logistic regression (LR) and neural network (NN) which are often used in many related work. To evaluate our approach simulated data, based on a sample of real anonymous transaction provided by a bank was used and the result shows that LR outperformed NN and CBR model, with a steady increase in precision, sensitivity and specificity as the percentage ratio for the training and test data were varied. This was due to the linearity, fuzziness and presence of uncertainty in the sampling dataset. Therefore, we can reach a conclusion that part of the possible reasons why there are few research in applying CBR to the context of detecting financial fraud patterns may be due to incomplete information, fuzziness and uncertainty in the available data sets used for experimentation.

        <p>
        Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is expected to be a key feature supported by 5G networks, especially due to the proliferation of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which has a prominent role in reducing network stress by shifting computational tasks from the Internet to the mobile edge. Apart from being part of MEC, D2D can extend cellular coverage allowing users to communicate directly when telecommunication infrastructure is highly congested or absent. This significant departure from the typical cellular paradigm imposes the need for decentralised network routing protocols. Moreover, enhanced capabilities of mobile devices and D2D networking will likely result in proliferation of new malware types and epidemics. Although the literature is rich in terms of D2D routing protocols that enhance quality-of-service and energy consumption, they provide only basic security support, e.g., in the form of encryption. Routing decisions can, however, contribute to collaborative detection of mobile malware by leveraging different kinds of anti-malware software installed on mobile devices. Benefiting from the cooperative nature of D2D communications, devices can rely on each others’ contributions to detect malware. The impact of our work is geared towards having more malware-free D2D networks. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel routing protocol for D2D communications that optimises routing decisions for explicitly improving malware detection. The protocol identifies optimal network paths, in terms of malware mitigation and energy spent for malware detection, based on a game theoretic model. Diverse capabilities of network devices running different types of anti-malware software and their potential for inspecting messages relayed towards an intended destination device are leveraged using game theoretic tools. An optimality analysis of both Nash and Stackelberg security games is undertaken, including both zero and non-zero sum variants, and the Defender’s equilibrium strategies. By undertaking network simulations, theoretical results obtained are illustrated through randomly generated network scenarios showing how our protocol outperforms conventional routing protocols, in terms of expected payoff, which consists of: security damage inflicted by malware and malware detection cost.

        This paper proposes a conceptual model to support decision makers during security analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The world is entering an era of ubiquitous computing with IoT being the main driver. Taking into account the scale of IoT, the number of security issues that are arising are unprecedented. Both academia and industry require methodologies that will enable reasoning about security in IoT system in a concise and holistic manner. The proposed conceptual model addresses a number of challenges in modeling IoT to support security analysis. The model is based on an architecture-oriented approach that incorporates sociotechnical concepts into the security analysis of an IoT system. To demonstrate the usage of the proposed conceptual model, we perform a security analysis on a small scale smart home example.

        Internet of Things (IoT) can be seen as the main driver towards an era of ubiquitous computing. Taking into account the scale of IoT, the number of security issues that emerge are unprecedented, therefore the need for proposing new methodologies for elaborating about security in IoT systems is undoubtedly crucial and this is recognised by both academia and the industry alike. In this work we present Apparatus, a conceptual model for reasoning about security in IoT systems through the lens of Security Requirements Engineering. Apparatus is architecture-oriented and describes an IoT system as a cluster of nodes that share network connections. The information of the system is documented in a textual manner, using Javascript Notation Object (JSON) format, in order to elicit security requirements. To demonstrate its usage the security requirements of a temperature monitor system are identified and a first application of Apparatus is exhibited.

        In this paper, a software tool for security analysis of IoT systems is presented. The tool, named ASTo (Apparatus Software Tool) enables the visualization of IoT systems using a domain-specific modeling language. The modeling language provides constructs to express the hardware, software and social concepts of an IoT system along with security concepts. Security issues of IoT systems are identified based on the attributes of the constructs and their relationships. Security analysis is facilitated using the visualization mechanisms of the tool to recognize the secure posture of an IoT system.

        <p>
        The occurrence of congestion has an extremely deleterious impact on the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This article presents a novel protocol, named COALA (COngestion ALleviation and Avoidance), which aims to act both proactively, in order to avoid the creation of congestion in WSNs, and reactively, so as to mitigate the diffusion of upcoming congestion through alternative path routing. Its operation is based on the utilization of an accumulative cost function, which considers both static and dynamic metrics in order to send data through the paths that are less probable to be congested. COALA is validated through simulation tests, which exhibit its ability to achieve remarkable reduction of loss ratios, transmission delays and energy dissipation. Moreover, the appropriate adjustment of the weighting of the accumulative cost function enables the algorithm to adapt to the performance criteria of individual case scenarios.

        <p>
        Cybersecurity has become a key factor that determines the success or failure of companies that rely on information systems. Therefore, investment in cybersecurity is an important financial and operational decision. Typical information technology investments aim to create value, whereas cybersecurity investments aim to minimize loss incurred by cyber attacks. Admittedly, cybersecurity investment has become an increasingly complex one, since information systems are typically subject to frequent attacks, whose arrival and impact fluctuate stochastically. Furthermore, cybersecurity measures and improvements, such as patches, become available at random points in time making investment decisions even more challenging. We propose and develop an analytical real options framework that incorporates major components relevant to cybersecurity practice, and analyze how optimal cybersecurity investment decisions perform for a private firm. The novelty of this paper is that it provides analytical solutions that lend themselves to intuitive interpretations regarding the effect of timing and cybersecurity risk on investment behavior using real options theory. Such aspects are frequently not implemented within economic models that support policy initiatives. However, if these are not properly understood, security controls will not be properly set resulting in a dynamic inefficiency reflected in cycles of over or under investment, and, in turn, increased cybersecurity risk following corrective policy actions. Results indicate that greater uncertainty over the cost of cybersecurity attacks raises the value of an embedded option to invest in cybersecurity. This increases the incentive to suspend operations temporarily in order to install a cybersecurity patch that will make the firm more resilient to cybersecurity breaches. Similarly, greater likelihood associated with the availability of a cybersecurity patch increases the value of the option to invest in cybersecurity. However, the absence of an embedded investment option increases the incentive to delay the permanent abandonment of the company's operation due to the irreversible nature of the decision.

        <p>
        When undertaking cybersecurity risk assessments, it is important to be able to assign numeric values to metrics to compute the final expected loss that represents the risk that an organization is exposed to due to cyber threats. Even if risk assessment is motivated by real-world observations and data, there is always a high chance of assigning inaccurate values due to different uncertainties involved (e.g., evolving threat landscape, human errors) and the natural difficulty of quantifying risk. Existing models empower organizations to compute optimal cybersecurity strategies given their financial constraints, i.e., available cybersecurity budget. Further, a general game-theoretic model with uncertain payoffs (probability-distribution-valued payoffs) shows that such uncertainty can be incorporated in the game-theoretic model by allowing payoffs to be random. This paper extends previous work in the field to tackle uncertainties in risk assessment that affect cybersecurity investments. The findings from simulated examples indicate that although uncertainties in cybersecurity risk assessment lead, on average, to different cybersecurity strategies, they do not play a significant role in the final expected loss of the organization when utilising a game-theoretic model and methodology to derive these strategies. The model determines robust defending strategies even when knowledge regarding risk assessment values is not accurate. As a result, it is possible to show that the cybersecurity investments’ tool is capable of providing effective decision support.

        The advancement of Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge devices with various types of sensors enables us to harness diverse information with Mobile Crowd-Sensing applications (MCS). This highly dynamic setting entails the collection of ubiquitous data traces, originating from sensors carried by people, introducing new information security challenges; one of them being the preservation of data trustworthiness. What is needed in these settings is the timely analysis of these large datasets to produce accurate insights on the correctness of user reports. Existing data mining and other artificial intelligence methods are the most popular to gain hidden insights from IoT data, albeit with many challenges. In this paper, we first model the cyber trustworthiness of MCS reports in the presence of intelligent and colluding adversaries. We then rigorously assess, using real IoT datasets, the effectiveness and accuracy of well-known data mining algorithms when employed towards IoT security and privacy. By taking into account the spatio-temporal changes of the underlying phenomena, we demonstrate how concept drifts can masquerade the existence of attackers and their impact on the accuracy of both the clustering and classification processes. Our initial set of results clearly show that these unsupervised learning algorithms are prone to adversarial infection, thus, magnifying the need for further research in the field by leveraging a mix of advanced machine learning models and mathematical optimization techniques.

Following this practice incident response plan developers are able to model and reason about security and recovery issues in medical cyber-physical systems from a security requirements engineering perspective. Our work builds upon concepts from the Secure Tropos methodology, where in this paper we introduce novel cyber-physical concepts, relationships and properties in order to carry out analysis of incident response plans based on security requirements. We illustrate our concepts through a case study of a radiological department’s medical cyber-physical systems that have been infected with the WannaCry ransomware. Finally, we discuss how our modelling language enriches security models with incident response concepts, guiding plan developers of health-based critical infrastructures in understanding cyber-physical systems vulnerabilities and support decision making at a tactical and a strategic level, through semi-automated secure recovery analysis

        <p>
        An insurer has to know the risks faced by a potential client to accurately determine an insurance premium offer. However, while the potential client might have a good understanding of its own security practices, it may also have an incentive not to disclose them honestly since the resulting information asymmetry could work in its favor. This information asymmetry engenders adverse selection, which can result in unfair premiums and reduced adoption of cyber-insurance. To overcome information asymmetry, insurers often require potential clients to self-report their risks. Still, clients do not have any incentive to perform thorough self-audits or to provide comprehensive reports. As a result, insurers have to complement self-reporting with external security audits to verify the clients’ reports. Since these audits can be very expensive, a key problem faced by insurers is to devise an auditing strategy that deters clients from dishonest reporting using a minimal number of audits. To solve this problem, we model the interactions between a potential client and an insurer as a two-player signaling game. One player represents the client, who knows its actual security-investment level, but may report any level to the insurer. The other player represents the insurer, who knows only the random distribution from which the security level was drawn, but may discover the actual level using an expensive audit. We study the players’ equilibrium strategies and provide numerical illustrations.

        Quantum-resistant identity-based signature with message recovery and proxy delegation

        <p>
        Digital signature with proxy delegation, which is a secure ownership enforcement tool, allows an original signer to delegate signature rights to a third party called proxy, so that the proxy can sign messages on behalf of the original signer. Many real-world applications make use of this secure mechanism, e.g., digital property transfer. A traditional digital signature mechanism is required to bind a message and its signature together for verification. This may yield extra cost in bandwidth while the sizes of message and signature are relatively huge. Message recovery signature, enabling to reduce the cost of bandwidth, embeds a message into the corresponding signature; therefore, only the signature will be transmitted to the verifier and the message can further be recovered from the signature. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose a novel digital signature scheme in the identity-based context with proxy delegation and message recovery features and, more importantly, our scheme is quantum resistant, in a particular lattice-based signature. Our scheme achieves delegation information and signature existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen warrant and identity. Compared with the seminal lattice-based message recovery signature, our scheme is independent from public key infrastructure, realizes delegation transfer of signature rights, and compresses signature length ulteriorly. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its type.

        A taxonomy and survey of cyber-physical intrusion detection approaches for vehicles

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        With the growing threat of cyber and cyber-physical attacks against automobiles, drones, ships, driverless pods and other vehicles, there is also a growing need for intrusion detection approaches that can facilitate defence against such threats. Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research.

        TAW: Cost-effective threshold authentication with weights for internet of things

        <p>
        In the Internet of Things, based on the collaboration of sensing nodes, sensing data are collected and transmitted. The collaboration of sensing nodes also plays an important role in the safeguard of the Internet of Things. Owing to the limited ability of the single sensing node, the threshold authentication based on the collaboration of sensing nodes can improve the trust of security authentication of sensing nodes. The current threshold authentication schemes may require high-computational complexity, and more importantly, most of them are instantiated by membership authentication. It's challenging to apply the current state of the arts to the case where sensing nodes with various weights join together to fulfill a relatively lightweight authentication. In this paper, we first design a communication key distribution scheme for sensing networks based on a symmetric operator. Using the permutation function, the scheme is able to generate characteristic sequences to improve the efficiency of key distribution in sensing networks. In addition, we propose a threshold authentication scheme based on weights, in which the higher weight represents the more important role in authentication. Our authentication scheme only requires lightweight operations, so that, it is extremely friendly to the IoT nodes with restricted computation power. The security analysis and the case verification demonstrate that our novel authentication protects IoT nodes without yielding significantly computational burden to the nodes.

        A new encrypted data switching protocol: bridging IBE and ABE without loss of data confidentiality

        <p>
        Encryption technologies have become one of the most prevalent solutions to safeguard data confidentiality in many real-world applications, e.g., cloud-based data storage systems. Encryption outputting a relatively “static” format of encrypted data, however, may hinder further data operations. For example, encrypted data may need to be “transformed” into other formats for computation or other purposes. To enable encryption to be used in another device equipped with a different encryption mechanism, the concept of encryption switching was first proposed in CRYPTO 2016 for conversion particularly between Paillier and ElGamal encryptions. This paper considers the conversion between conventional identity-based and attribute-based encryptions and further proposes a concrete construction via the technique of proxy re-encryption. The construction is proved to be CPA secure in the standard model under q-decisional parallel bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. The performance comparisons highlight that our bridging mechanism reduces computation and communication cost on the client side, especially when the data of the client is encrypted and outsourced to a remote cloud. The computational costs with respect to re-encryption (on the server side) and decryption (on the client side) are acceptable in practice.

Security in IoT requires domain-specific methodologies and tools. The proposed methodologies need to be able to capture information from software and hardware constructs to security and social constructs. In this paper, in addition to refining the modeling language of the Apparatus Framework, we propose a class-based notation of the modeling language and a structured approach to transition between different models. Apparatus is a security framework developed to facilitate security analysis in IoT systems. We demonstrate the application of the framework by analyzing the security of smart public transport system. The security analysis and visualization of the system are facilitated by a software application that is developed as part of the Apparatus Framework.

        <p>
        Security for smart industrial systems is prominent due to the proliferation of cyber threats threatening national critical infrastructures. Smart grid comes with intelligent applications that can utilize the bidirectional communication network among its entities. Microgrids are small-scale smart grids that enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communications as they can operate with some degree of independence from the main grid. In addition to protecting critical microgrid applications, an underlying key management scheme is needed to enable secure M2M message transmission and authentication. Existing key management schemes are not adequate due to microgrid special features and requirements. In this article, we propose the Micro sElf-orgaNiSed mAnagement (MENSA), which is the first hybrid key management and authentication scheme that combines public key infrastructure and web-of-trust concepts in microgrids. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of MENSA in terms of scalability and swiftness.

        <p>
        In recent years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become an active area of research for monitoring physical and environmental conditions. Due to the interdependence of sensors, a functional anomaly in one sensor can cause a functional anomaly in another sensor, which can further lead to the malfunctioning of the entire sensor network. Existing research work has analysed faulty sensor anomalies but fails to show the effectiveness throughout the entire interdependent network system. In this article, a dictionary learning algorithm based on a non-negative constraint is developed, and a sparse representation anomaly node detection method for sensor networks is proposed based on the dictionary learning. Through experiment on a specific thermal power plant in China, we verify the robustness of our proposed method in detecting abnormal nodes against four state of the art approaches and proved our method is more robust. Furthermore, the experiments are conducted on the obtained abnormal nodes to prove the interdependence of multi-layer sensor networks and reveal the conditions and causes of a system crash.

        In this paper, we define a cyber deception game between the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) network administrator (henceforth, defender) and attacker. The defender decides to install between a low-interaction honeypot, high-interaction honeypot, and a real system with no honeypot. The attacker decides on whether or not to attack the system given her belief about the type of device she is facing. We model this interaction as a Bayesian game with complete but imperfect information. The choice of honeypot type is private information and characterizes the essence and objective of the defender i.e., the degree of deception and amount of threat intelligence. We study the players’ equilibrium strategies and provide numerical illustrations. The work presented in this paper has been motivated by the H2020 SPEAR project which investigates the implementation of honeypots in smart grid infrastructures to: (i) contribute towards creating attack data sets for training a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and (ii) to support post-incident forensics analysis by having recorded a collection of evidence regarding an attacker’s actions.

        Post-incident audits on cyber insurance discounts

        <p>
        We introduce a game-theoretic model to investigate the strategic interaction between a cyber insurance policyholder whose premium depends on her self-reported security level and an insurer with the power to audit the security level upon receiving an indemnity claim. Audits can reveal fraudulent (or simply careless) policyholders not following reported security procedures, in which case the insurer can refuse to indemnify the policyholder. However, the insurer has to bear an audit cost even when the policyholders have followed the prescribed security procedures. As audits can be expensive, a key problem insurers face is to devise an auditing strategy to deter policyholders from misrepresenting their security levels to gain a premium discount. This decision-making problem was motivated by conducting interviews with underwriters and reviewing regulatory filings in the US; we discovered that premiums are determined by security posture, yet this is often self-reported and insurers are concerned by whether security procedures are practised as reported by the policyholders. To address this problem, we model this interaction as a Bayesian game of incomplete information and devise optimal auditing strategies for the insurers considering the possibility that the policyholder may misrepresent her security level. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first theoretical consideration of post-incident claims management in cyber security. Our model captures the trade-off between the incentive to exaggerate security posture during the application process and the possibility of punishment for non-compliance with reported security policies. Simulations demonstrate that common sense techniques are not as efficient at providing effective cyber insurance audit decisions as the ones computed using game theory.

        Optimizing investments in cyber hygiene for protecting healthcare users

        <p>
        Cyber hygiene measures are often recommended for strengthening an organization’s security posture, especially for protecting against social engineering attacks that target the human element. However, the related recommendations are typically the same for all organizations and their employees, regardless of the nature and the level of risk for different groups of users. Building upon an existing cybersecurity investment model, this paper presents a tool for optimal selection of cyber hygiene safeguards, which we refer as the Optimal Safeguards Tool (OST). The model combines game theory and combinatorial optimization (0-1 Knapsack) taking into account the probability of each user group to being attacked, the value of assets accessible by each group, and the efficacy of each control for a particular group. The model considers indirect cost as the time employees could require for learning and trainning against an implemented control. Utilizing a game-theoretic framework to support the Knapsack optimization problem permits us to optimally select safeguards’ application levels minimizing the aggregated expected damage within a security investment budget. We evaluate OST in a healthcare domain use case. In particular, on the Critical Internet Security (CIS) Control group 17 for implementing security awareness and training programs for employees belonging to the ICT, clinical and administration personnel of a hospital. We compare the strategies implemented by OST against alternative common-sense defending approaches for three different types of attackers: Nash, Weighted and Opportunistic. Our results show that Nash defending strategies are consistently better than the competing strategies for all attacker types with a minor exception where the Nash defending strategy, for a specific game, performs at least as good as other common-sense approaches. Finally, we illustrate the alternative investment strategies on different Nash equilibria (called plans) and discuss the optimal choice using the framework of 0-1 Knapsack optimization.

        Post quantum proxy signature scheme based on the multivariate public key cryptographic signature

        <p>
        Proxy signature is a very useful technique which allows the original signer to delegate the signing capability to a proxy signer to perform the signing operation. It finds wide applications especially in the distributed environment where the entities such as the wireless sensors are short of computational power and needed to be convinced to the authenticity of the server. Due to less proxy signature schemes in the post-quantum cryptography aspect, in this article, we investigate the proxy signature in the post-quantum setting so that it can resist against the potential attacks from the quantum adversaries. A general multivariate public key cryptographic proxy scheme based on a multivariate public key cryptographic signature scheme is proposed, and a heuristic security proof is given for our general construction. We show that the construction can reach Existential Unforgeability under an Adaptive Chosen Message Attack with Proxy Key Exposure assuming that the underlying signature is Existential Unforgeability under an Adaptive Chosen Message Attack. We then use our general scheme to construct practical proxy signature schemes for three well-known and promising multivariate public key cryptographic signature schemes. We implement our schemes and compare with several previous constructions to show our efficiency advantage, which further indicates the potential application prospect in the distributed network environment.

        Dynamic decision support for resource offloading in heterogeneous internet of things environments

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        Computation offloading is one of the primary technological enablers of the Internet of Things (IoT), as it helps address individual devices’ resource restrictions. In the past, offloading would always utilise remote cloud infrastructures, but the increasing size of IoT data traffic and the real-time response requirements of modern and future IoT applications have led to the adoption of the edge computing paradigm, where the data is processed at the edge of the network. The decision as to whether cloud or edge resources will be utilised is typically taken at the design stage based on the type of the IoT device. Yet, the conditions that determine the optimality of this decision, such as the arrival rate, nature and sizes of the tasks, and crucially the real-time condition of the networks involved, keep changing. At the same time, the energy consumption of IoT devices is usually a key requirement, which is affected primarily by the time it takes to complete tasks, whether for the actual computation or for offloading them through the network. Here, we model the expected time and energy costs for the different options of offloading a task to the edge or the cloud, as well as of carrying out on the device itself. We use this model to allow the device to take the offloading decision dynamically as a new task arrives and based on the available information on the network connections and the states of the edge and the cloud. Having extended EdgeCloudSim to provide support for such dynamic decision making, we are able to compare this approach against IoT-first, edge-first, cloud-only, random and application-oriented probabilistic strategies. Our simulations on four different types of IoT applications show that allowing customisation and dynamic offloading decision support can improve drastically the response time of time-critical and small-size applications, and the energy consumption not only of the individual IoT devices but also of the system as a whole. This paves the way for future IoT devices that optimise their application response times, as well as their own energy autonomy and overall energy efficiency, in a decentralised and autonomous manner.

        <p>
        With the growing popularity of cloud computing in recent years, data owners (DOs) now prefer to outsource their data to cloud servers and allow the specific data users (DUs) to retrieve the data. Searchable encryption is an important tool to provide secure search over the encrypted cloud data without infringing data confidentiality and data privacy. In this work, we consider a secure search service providing fine-grained and search functionality, called attribute-based multiple keyword search (ABMKS), which can be seen as an extension of searchable encryption. In the existing ABMKS schemes, the computation operations in the encrypted keyword index generation are time-consuming modular exponentiation, and the number of which is linearly growing with the factor $m$. Here $m$ is the number of keywords embedded in a file. To reduce the computation overhead, in this paper, we propose an ABMKS with only multiplication operations in encrypted keyword index generation. As a result, the computation cost of the encrypted keyword index generation is more efficient than the existing schemes. In addition, the encrypted keyword indexes are aggregated into one item, which is regardless of the number of underlying keywords in a file data. Finally, the security and the performance analysis demonstrate that our scheme is both efficient and secure.

        Cache-based privacy preserving solution for location and content protection in location-based services

        <p>
        Location-Based Services (LBSs) are playing an increasingly important role in people’s daily activities nowadays. While enjoying the convenience provided by LBSs, users may lose privacy since they report their personal information to the untrusted LBS server. Although many approaches have been proposed to preserve users’ privacy, most of them just focus on the user’s location privacy, but do not consider the query privacy. Moreover, many existing approaches rely heavily on a trusted third-party (TTP) server, which may suffer from a single point of failure. To solve the problems above, in this paper we propose a Cache-Based Privacy-Preserving (CBPP) solution for users in LBSs. Different from the previous approaches, the proposed CBPP solution protects location privacy and query privacy simultaneously, while avoiding the problem of TTP server by having users collaborating with each other in a mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. In the CBPP solution, each user keeps a buffer in his mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to record service data and acts as a micro TTP server. When a user needs LBSs, he sends a query to his neighbors first to seek for an answer. The user only contacts the LBS server when he cannot obtain the required service data from his neighbors. In this way, the user reduces the number of queries sent to the LBS server. We argue that the fewer queries are submitted to the LBS server, the less the user’s privacy is exposed. To users who have to send live queries to the LBS server, we employ the l-diversity, a powerful privacy protection definition that can guarantee the user’s privacy against attackers using background knowledge, to further protect their privacy. Evaluation results show that the proposed CBPP solution can effectively protect users’ location and query privacy with a lower communication cost and better quality of service.

        The modern Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home is a challenging environment to secure: devices change, new vulnerabilities are discovered and often remain unpatched, and different users interact with their devices differently and have different cyber risk attitudes. A security breach's impact is not limited to cyberspace, as it can also affect or be facilitated in physical space, for example, via voice. In this environment, intrusion detection cannot rely solely on static models that remain the same over time and are the same for all users. We present MAGPIE, the first smart home intrusion detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home's changing conditions (e.g., new devices, new automation rules and user interaction with them). The method achieves this goal by applying a novel probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism to non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning. MAGPIE rewards the sets of hyperparameters of its underlying isolation forest unsupervised anomaly classifiers based on the cluster silhouette scores of their output. Experimental evaluation in a real household shows that MAGPIE exhibits high accuracy because of two further innovations: it takes into account both cyber and physical sources of data; and it detects human presence to utilise models that exhibit the highest accuracy in each case. MAGPIE is available in open-source format, together with its evaluation datasets, so it can benefit from future advances in unsupervised and reinforcement learning and be able to be enriched with further sources of data as smart home environments and attacks evolve.

        <p>
        Cyber attacks consisting of several attack actions can present considerable challenge to forensic investigations. Consider the case where a cybersecurity breach is suspected following the discovery of one attack action, for example by observing the modification of sensitive registry keys, suspicious network traffic patterns, or the abuse of legitimate credentials. At this point, the investigator can have multiple options as to what to check next to discover the rest, and will likely pick one based on experience and training. This will be the case at each new step. We argue that the efficiency of this aspect of the job, which is the selection of what next step to take, can have significant impact on its overall cost (e.g., the duration) of the investigation and can be improved through the application of constrained optimization techniques. Here, we present DISCLOSE, the first data-driven decision support framework for optimizing forensic investigations of cybersecurity breaches. DISCLOSE benefits from a repository of known adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), for each of which it harvests threat intelligence information to calculate its probabilistic relations with the rest. These relations, as well as a proximity parameter derived from the projection of quantitative data regarding the adversarial TTPs on an attack life cycle model, are both used as input to our optimization framework. We show the feasibility of this approach in a case study that consists of 31 adversarial TTPs, data collected from 6 interviews with experienced cybersecurity professionals and data extracted from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK STIX repository and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

        Insurance, in general, is a financial contract between the one buying the insurance (also known as the policyholder or insured) and the one providing insurance (known as insurance carrier or insurer). The contract, known as the insurance policy, typically states that the policyholder will pay a regular insurance premium in exchange for a financial compensation, also known as indemnification, in the event of a loss defined in the insurance policy. Insurance is used to manage risks by transferring them to the insurer, and cyber-insurance in particular deals with cyber risks covering direct and indirect damages caused by cyberattacks. The cyber-insurance market is still growing and has been receiving broader interest from research communities and government bodies over the years. This paper provides an overview of cyber-insurance, novel models proposed throughout the years and future challenges to be addressed for cyber-insurance to become a key component of an organisation’s and household’s cyber risk management approach.

        Influence of human factors on cyber security within healthcare organisations: A systematic review

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        Cybersecurity is increasingly becoming a prominent concern among health- care providers in adopting digital technologies for improving the quality of care delivered to patients. The recent reports on cyber attacks, such as ransomware and WannaCry, have brought to life the destructive nature of such attacks upon healthcare. In complement to cyberattacks, which have been targeted against the vulnerabilities of information technology (IT) infrastructures, a new form of cyber attack aims to exploit human vulnerabilities; such attacks are categorised as social engineering attacks. Following an increase in the frequency and ingenuity of attacks launched against hospitals and clinical environments with the intention of causing service disruption, there is a strong need to study the level of awareness programmes and training activities offered to the staff by healthcare organisations. Objective: The objective of this systematic review is to identify commonly encountered factors that cybersecurity postures of a healthcare organisation, resulting from the ignorance of cyber threat to healthcare. The systematic review aims to consolidate the current literature being reported upon human behaviour resulting in security gaps that mitigate the cyber defence strategy adopted by healthcare organisations. Additionally, the paper also reviews the organisational risk assessment methodology implemented and the policies being adopted to strengthen cybersecurity. Methods: The topic of cybersecurity within healthcare and the clinical environment has attracted the interest of several researchers, resulting in a broad range of literature. The inclusion criteria for the articles in the review stem from the scope of the five research questions identified. To this end, we conducted seven search queries across three repositories, namely (i) PubMed®/MED-LINE; (ii) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and (iii) Web of Science (WoS), using key words related to cybersecurity awareness, training, organisation risk assessment methodologies, policies and recommendations adopted as counter measures within health care. These were restricted to around the last 12 years. Results: A total of 70 articles were selected to be included in the review, which addresses the complexity of cybersecurity measures adopted within the healthcare and clinical environments. The articles included in the review highlight the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats stemming from exploiting IT infrastructures to more advanced attacks launched with the intent of exploiting human vulnerability. A steady increase in the literature on the threat of phishing attacks evidences the growing threat of social engineering attacks. As a countermeasure, through the review, we identified articles that provide methodologies resulting from case studies to promote cybersecurity awareness among stakeholders. The articles included highlight the need to adopt cyber hygiene practices among healthcare professionals while accessing social media platforms, which forms an ideal test bed for the attackers to gain insight into the life of healthcare professionals. Additionally, the review also includes articles that present strategies adopted by healthcare organisations in countering the impact of social engineering attacks. The evaluation of the cybersecurity risk assessment of an organisation is another key area of study reported in the literature that recommends the organisation of European and international standards in countering social engineering attacks. Lastly, the review includes articles reporting on national case studies with an overview of the economic and societal impact of service disruptions encountered due to cyberattacks. Discussion: One of the limitations of the review is the subjective ranking of the authors associated to the relevance of literature to each of the research questions identified. We also acknowledge the limited amount of literature that focuses on human factors of cybersecurity in health care in general; therefore, the search queries were formulated using well-established cybersecurity related topics categorised according to the threats, risk assessment and organisational strategies reported in the literature.

        Automated cyber and privacy risk management toolkit

        <p>
        Addressing cyber and privacy risks has never been more critical for organisations. While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (AutoMated cyBer and prIvacy risk managEmeNt Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit, in the academic literature, that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats.

        <p>
        The use of anti-forensic techniques is a very common practice that stealthy adversaries may deploy to minimise their traces and make the investigation of an incident harder by evading detection and attribution. In this paper, we study the interaction between a cyber forensic Investigator and a strategic Attacker using a game-theoretic framework. This is based on a Bayesian game of incomplete information played on a multi-host cyber forensics investigation graph of actions traversed by both players. The edges of the graph represent players’ actions across different hosts in a network. In alignment with the concept of Bayesian games, we define 8 two Attacker types to represent their ability of deploying anti-forensic techniques to conceal their activities. In this way, our model allows the Investigator to identify her optimal investigating 10 policy taking into consideration the cost and impact of the available actions, while coping with the uncertainty of the Attacker’s type and strategic decisions. To evaluate our model, we construct a realistic case study based on threat reports and data extracted from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK STIX repository, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and interviews with cyber-security practitioners. We use the case study to compare the performance of the proposed method against 15 two other investigative methods and three different types of Attackers.

        In order to protect user privacy and provide better access control in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, designing an appropriate two-party authentication and key exchange protocol is a prominent challenge. In this paper, we propose a lightweight certificateless non-interactive authentication and key exchange (CNAKE) protocol for mutual authentication between remote users and smart devices. Based on elliptic curves, our lightweight protocol provides high security performance, realizes non-interactive authentication between the two entities, and effectively reduces communication overhead. Under the random oracle model, the proposed protocol is provably secure based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman and Bilinear Diffie-Hellman hardness assumption. Finally, through a series of experiments and comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate that our scheme is fast and secure.

        Assessing the risk posed by Advanced Cyber Threats (APTs) is challenging without understanding the methods and tactics adversaries use to attack an organisation. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK provides information on the motivation, capabilities, interests and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. In this paper, we leverage these characteristics of threat actors to support informed cyber risk characterisation and assessment. In particular, we utilise the MITRE repository of known adversarial TTPs along with attack graphs to determine the attack probability as well as the likelihood of success of an attack. We further identify attack paths with the highest likelihood of success considering the techniques and procedures of a threat actor. The assessment is supported by a case study of a health care organisation to identify the level of risk against two adversary groups– Lazarus and menuPass.

        HoneyCar: A framework to configure honeypot vulnerabilities on the internet of vehicles

        <p>
        The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), whereby interconnected vehicles that communicate with each other and with road infrastructure on a common network, has promising socio-economic benefits but also poses new cyber-physical threats. To protect these entities and learn about adversaries, data on attackers can be realistically gathered using decoy systems like honeypots. Admittedly, honeypots introduces a trade-off between the level of honeypot-attacker interactions and incurred overheads and costs for implementing and monitoring these systems. Deception through honeypots can be achieved by strategically configuring the honeypots to represent components of the IoV to engage attackers and collect cyber threat intelligence. Here, we present HoneyCar, a novel decision support framework for honeypot deception in IoV. HoneyCar benefits from the repository of known vulnerabilities of the autonomous and connected vehicles found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database to compute optimal honeypot configuration strategies. The adversarial interaction is modelled as a repeated imperfect-information zero-sum game where the IoV network administrator strategically chooses a set of vulnerabilities to offer in a honeypot and a strategic attacker chooses a vulnerability to exploit under uncertainty. Our investigation examines two different versions of the game, with and without the re-configuration cost, to empower the network administrator to determine optimal honeypot investment strategies given a budget. We show the feasibility of this approach in a case study that consists of the vulnerabilities in autonomous and connected vehicles gathered from the CVE database and data extracted from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

        <p>
        The increase in the complexity and sophistication of multi-stage cyber attacks, such as advanced persistent threats, paired with the large volume of data produced by modern systems and networks, have made forensic investigations more demanding in knowledge and resources. Thus, it is essential that cyber forensic investigators are supported to operate more efficiently, in terms of resources and evidence recovery, and cope with a wide range of cyber incidents. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of 49 works that aim to sup- port cyber forensic investigations of modern multi-stage cyber incidents and highlights the need for decision support systems on the field. The works reviewed are compared using 11 criteria, such as their evaluation method, how they optimise the forensic process, or what stage of investigation they study. We also classify the surveyed papers using 8 categories that represent the overall aim of the proposed cyber investigation method or tool. We identify and discuss open issues, arising from this extensive survey, such as the need for realistic evaluation, as well as realistic and representative modelling to increase applicability and performance. Finally, we provide directions for future research on improving the state-of-the-art of cyber forensics.

        Principled data-driven decision support for cyber-forensic investigations

        <p>
        In the wake of a cybersecurity incident, it is crucial to promptly discover how the threat actors breached security in order to assess the impact of the incident and to develop and deploy countermeasures that can protect against further attacks. To this end, defenders can launch a cyber-forensic investigation, which discovers the techniques that the threat actors used in the incident. A fundamental challenge in such an investigation is prioritizing the investigation of particular techniques since the investigation of each technique requires time and effort, but forensic analysts cannot know which ones were actually used before investigating them. To ensure prompt discovery, it is imperative to provide decision support that can help forensic analysts with this prioritization. A recent study demonstrated that data-driven decision support, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state- of-the-art prioritization. However, this data-driven approach, called DISCLOSE, is based on a heuristic that utilizes only a subset of the available information and does not approximate optimal decisions. To improve upon this heuristic, we introduce a principled approach for data-driven decision support for cyber-forensic investigations. We formulate the decision-support problem using a Markov decision process, whose states represent the states of a forensic investigation. To solve the decision problem, we propose a Monte Carlo tree search based method, which relies on a k-NN regression over prior incidents to estimate state-transition probabilities. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple versions of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK dataset, which is a knowledge base of adversarial techniques and tactics based on real-world cyber incidents, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms DISCLOSE in terms of techniques discovered per effort spent.

        Virtually Secure: A taxonomic assessment of cybersecurity challenges in virtual reality environments

        <p>
        Although Virtual Reality (VR) is certainly not a new technology, its recent adoption across several sectors beyond entertainment has led the information security research community to take note of the new cyber threats that come with it. The variety of system components presents an extensive attack surface that can be exploited. At the same time, VR’s emphasis on immersion, interaction and presence means that the user can be targeted directly, yet the use of head-mounted displays may prevent them from observing a cyber attack’s impact in their immediate physical environment. This paper presents the first taxonomic representation of VR security challenges. By systemically classifying existing VR cyber threats against existing defences in a single comparative matrix, we aim to help researchers from different backgrounds to identify key focus areas where further research would be most beneficial.

        <p>
        In this paper we present a structured methodology for improving the cyber hygiene perception and behaviour of personnel in the healthcare sector. The applicability and added value of the proposed CH methodology is demonstrated using real- life survey data collected at 3 European healthcare organisations. Our findings suggest that there are considerable differences with respect to human-oriented cybersecurity and data privacy risks across different organisations and diverse employee groups within the same organisation. By applying the CH methodology, we provide the risk strategies together with the list of recommended human-centric controls for managing a wide range of cybersecurity and data privacy risks related to healthcare employees.
