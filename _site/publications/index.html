        <p>
        In this paper we present a structured methodology for improving the cyber hygiene perception and behaviour of personnel in the healthcare sector. The applicability and added value of the proposed CH methodology is demonstrated using real- life survey data collected at 3 European healthcare organisations. Our findings suggest that there are considerable differences with respect to human-oriented cybersecurity and data privacy risks across different organisations and diverse employee groups within the same organisation. By applying the CH methodology, we provide the risk strategies together with the list of recommended human-centric controls for managing a wide range of cybersecurity and data privacy risks related to healthcare employees.

        Principled data-driven decision support for cyber-forensic investigations

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        In the wake of a cybersecurity incident, it is crucial to promptly discover how the threat actors breached security in order to assess the impact of the incident and to develop and deploy countermeasures that can protect against further attacks. To this end, defenders can launch a cyber-forensic investigation, which discovers the techniques that the threat actors used in the incident. A fundamental challenge in such an investigation is prioritizing the investigation of particular techniques since the investigation of each technique requires time and effort, but forensic analysts cannot know which ones were actually used before investigating them. To ensure prompt discovery, it is imperative to provide decision support that can help forensic analysts with this prioritization. A recent study demonstrated that data-driven decision support, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state- of-the-art prioritization. However, this data-driven approach, called DISCLOSE, is based on a heuristic that utilizes only a subset of the available information and does not approximate optimal decisions. To improve upon this heuristic, we introduce a principled approach for data-driven decision support for cyber-forensic investigations. We formulate the decision-support problem using a Markov decision process, whose states represent the states of a forensic investigation. To solve the decision problem, we propose a Monte Carlo tree search based method, which relies on a k-NN regression over prior incidents to estimate state-transition probabilities. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple versions of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK dataset, which is a knowledge base of adversarial techniques and tactics based on real-world cyber incidents, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms DISCLOSE in terms of techniques discovered per effort spent.

        MITRE ATT&amp;CK-driven cyber risk assessment

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        Assessing the risk posed by Advanced Cyber Threats (APTs) is challenging without understanding the methods and tactics adversaries use to attack an organisation. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK provides information on the motivation, capabilities, interests and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. In this paper, we leverage these characteristics of threat actors to support informed cyber risk characterisation and assessment. In particular, we utilise the MITRE repository of known adversarial TTPs along with attack graphs to determine the attack probability as well as the likelihood of success of an attack. We further identify attack paths with the highest likelihood of success considering the techniques and procedures of a threat actor. The assessment is supported by a case study of a health care organisation to identify the level of risk against two adversary groups– Lazarus and menuPass.

        Automated cyber and privacy risk management toolkit

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        Addressing cyber and privacy risks has never been more critical for organisations. While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (AutoMated cyBer and prIvacy risk managEmeNt Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit, in the academic literature, that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats.

        Self-configurable cyber-physical intrusion detection for smart homes using reinforcement learning

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        The modern Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home is a challenging environment to secure: devices change, new vulnerabilities are discovered and often remain unpatched, and different users interact with their devices differently and have different cyber risk attitudes. A security breach's impact is not limited to cyberspace, as it can also affect or be facilitated in physical space, for example, via voice. In this environment, intrusion detection cannot rely solely on static models that remain the same over time and are the same for all users. We present MAGPIE, the first smart home intrusion detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home's changing conditions (e.g., new devices, new automation rules and user interaction with them). The method achieves this goal by applying a novel probabilistic cluster-based reward mechanism to non-stationary multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning. MAGPIE rewards the sets of hyperparameters of its underlying isolation forest unsupervised anomaly classifiers based on the cluster silhouette scores of their output. Experimental evaluation in a real household shows that MAGPIE exhibits high accuracy because of two further innovations: it takes into account both cyber and physical sources of data; and it detects human presence to utilise models that exhibit the highest accuracy in each case. MAGPIE is available in open-source format, together with its evaluation datasets, so it can benefit from future advances in unsupervised and reinforcement learning and be able to be enriched with further sources of data as smart home environments and attacks evolve.

        Cache-based privacy preserving solution for location and content protection in location-based services

        <p>
        Location-Based Services (LBSs) are playing an increasingly important role in people’s daily activities nowadays. While enjoying the convenience provided by LBSs, users may lose privacy since they report their personal information to the untrusted LBS server. Although many approaches have been proposed to preserve users’ privacy, most of them just focus on the user’s location privacy, but do not consider the query privacy. Moreover, many existing approaches rely heavily on a trusted third-party (TTP) server, which may suffer from a single point of failure. To solve the problems above, in this paper we propose a Cache-Based Privacy-Preserving (CBPP) solution for users in LBSs. Different from the previous approaches, the proposed CBPP solution protects location privacy and query privacy simultaneously, while avoiding the problem of TTP server by having users collaborating with each other in a mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. In the CBPP solution, each user keeps a buffer in his mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to record service data and acts as a micro TTP server. When a user needs LBSs, he sends a query to his neighbors first to seek for an answer. The user only contacts the LBS server when he cannot obtain the required service data from his neighbors. In this way, the user reduces the number of queries sent to the LBS server. We argue that the fewer queries are submitted to the LBS server, the less the user’s privacy is exposed. To users who have to send live queries to the LBS server, we employ the l-diversity, a powerful privacy protection definition that can guarantee the user’s privacy against attackers using background knowledge, to further protect their privacy. Evaluation results show that the proposed CBPP solution can effectively protect users’ location and query privacy with a lower communication cost and better quality of service.

        An efficient attribute-based multi-keyword search scheme in encrypted keyword generation

        <p>
        With the growing popularity of cloud computing in recent years, data owners (DOs) now prefer to outsource their data to cloud servers and allow the specific data users (DUs) to retrieve the data. Searchable encryption is an important tool to provide secure search over the encrypted cloud data without infringing data confidentiality and data privacy. In this work, we consider a secure search service providing fine-grained and search functionality, called attribute-based multiple keyword search (ABMKS), which can be seen as an extension of searchable encryption. In the existing ABMKS schemes, the computation operations in the encrypted keyword index generation are time-consuming modular exponentiation, and the number of which is linearly growing with the factor $m$. Here $m$ is the number of keywords embedded in a file. To reduce the computation overhead, in this paper, we propose an ABMKS with only multiplication operations in encrypted keyword index generation. As a result, the computation cost of the encrypted keyword index generation is more efficient than the existing schemes. In addition, the encrypted keyword indexes are aggregated into one item, which is regardless of the number of underlying keywords in a file data. Finally, the security and the performance analysis demonstrate that our scheme is both efficient and secure.

        Dynamic decision support for resource offloading in heterogeneous internet of things environments

        <blockquote>
        <p>
        Computation offloading is one of the primary technological enablers of the Internet of Things (IoT), as it helps address individual devices’ resource restrictions. In the past, offloading would always utilise remote cloud infrastructures, but the increasing size of IoT data traffic and the real-time response requirements of modern and future IoT applications have led to the adoption of the edge computing paradigm, where the data is processed at the edge of the network. The decision as to whether cloud or edge resources will be utilised is typically taken at the design stage based on the type of the IoT device. Yet, the conditions that determine the optimality of this decision, such as the arrival rate, nature and sizes of the tasks, and crucially the real-time condition of the networks involved, keep changing. At the same time, the energy consumption of IoT devices is usually a key requirement, which is affected primarily by the time it takes to complete tasks, whether for the actual computation or for offloading them through the network. Here, we model the expected time and energy costs for the different options of offloading a task to the edge or the cloud, as well as of carrying out on the device itself. We use this model to allow the device to take the offloading decision dynamically as a new task arrives and based on the available information on the network connections and the states of the edge and the cloud. Having extended EdgeCloudSim to provide support for such dynamic decision making, we are able to compare this approach against IoT-first, edge-first, cloud-only, random and application-oriented probabilistic strategies. Our simulations on four different types of IoT applications show that allowing customisation and dynamic offloading decision support can improve drastically the response time of time-critical and small-size applications, and the energy consumption not only of the individual IoT devices but also of the system as a whole. This paves the way for future IoT devices that optimise their application response times, as well as their own energy autonomy and overall energy efficiency, in a decentralised and autonomous manner.

        Post quantum proxy signature scheme based on the multivariate public key cryptographic signature

        <p>
        Proxy signature is a very useful technique which allows the original signer to delegate the signing capability to a proxy signer to perform the signing operation. It finds wide applications especially in the distributed environment where the entities such as the wireless sensors are short of computational power and needed to be convinced to the authenticity of the server. Due to less proxy signature schemes in the post-quantum cryptography aspect, in this article, we investigate the proxy signature in the post-quantum setting so that it can resist against the potential attacks from the quantum adversaries. A general multivariate public key cryptographic proxy scheme based on a multivariate public key cryptographic signature scheme is proposed, and a heuristic security proof is given for our general construction. We show that the construction can reach Existential Unforgeability under an Adaptive Chosen Message Attack with Proxy Key Exposure assuming that the underlying signature is Existential Unforgeability under an Adaptive Chosen Message Attack. We then use our general scheme to construct practical proxy signature schemes for three well-known and promising multivariate public key cryptographic signature schemes. We implement our schemes and compare with several previous constructions to show our efficiency advantage, which further indicates the potential application prospect in the distributed network environment.

        <p>
        In this paper, we define a cyber deception game between the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) network administrator (henceforth, defender) and attacker. The defender decides to install between a low-interaction honeypot, high-interaction honeypot, and a real system with no honeypot. The attacker decides on whether or not to attack the system given her belief about the type of device she is facing. We model this interaction as a Bayesian game with complete but imperfect information. The choice of honeypot type is private information and characterizes the essence and objective of the defender i.e., the degree of deception and amount of threat intelligence. We study the players’ equilibrium strategies and provide numerical illustrations. The work presented in this paper has been motivated by the H2020 SPEAR project which investigates the implementation of honeypots in smart grid infrastructures to: (i) contribute towards creating attack data sets for training a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and (ii) to support post-incident forensics analysis by having recorded a collection of evidence regarding an attacker’s actions.

        <p>
        In recent years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become an active area of research for monitoring physical and environmental conditions. Due to the interdependence of sensors, a functional anomaly in one sensor can cause a functional anomaly in another sensor, which can further lead to the malfunctioning of the entire sensor network. Existing research work has analysed faulty sensor anomalies but fails to show the effectiveness throughout the entire interdependent network system. In this article, a dictionary learning algorithm based on a non-negative constraint is developed, and a sparse representation anomaly node detection method for sensor networks is proposed based on the dictionary learning. Through experiment on a specific thermal power plant in China, we verify the robustness of our proposed method in detecting abnormal nodes against four state of the art approaches and proved our method is more robust. Furthermore, the experiments are conducted on the obtained abnormal nodes to prove the interdependence of multi-layer sensor networks and reveal the conditions and causes of a system crash.

        <p>
        Security for smart industrial systems is prominent due to the proliferation of cyber threats threatening national critical infrastructures. Smart grid comes with intelligent applications that can utilize the bidirectional communication network among its entities. Microgrids are small-scale smart grids that enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communications as they can operate with some degree of independence from the main grid. In addition to protecting critical microgrid applications, an underlying key management scheme is needed to enable secure M2M message transmission and authentication. Existing key management schemes are not adequate due to microgrid special features and requirements. In this article, we propose the Micro sElf-orgaNiSed mAnagement (MENSA), which is the first hybrid key management and authentication scheme that combines public key infrastructure and web-of-trust concepts in microgrids. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of MENSA in terms of scalability and swiftness.

        <p>
        Encryption technologies have become one of the most prevalent solutions to safeguard data confidentiality in many real-world applications, e.g., cloud-based data storage systems. Encryption outputting a relatively “static” format of encrypted data, however, may hinder further data operations. For example, encrypted data may need to be “transformed” into other formats for computation or other purposes. To enable encryption to be used in another device equipped with a different encryption mechanism, the concept of encryption switching was first proposed in CRYPTO 2016 for conversion particularly between Paillier and ElGamal encryptions. This paper considers the conversion between conventional identity-based and attribute-based encryptions and further proposes a concrete construction via the technique of proxy re-encryption. The construction is proved to be CPA secure in the standard model under q-decisional parallel bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. The performance comparisons highlight that our bridging mechanism reduces computation and communication cost on the client side, especially when the data of the client is encrypted and outsourced to a remote cloud. The computational costs with respect to re-encryption (on the server side) and decryption (on the client side) are acceptable in practice.

        A taxonomy and survey of cyber-physical intrusion detection approaches for vehicles

        <p>
        With the growing threat of cyber and cyber-physical attacks against automobiles, drones, ships, driverless pods and other vehicles, there is also a growing need for intrusion detection approaches that can facilitate defence against such threats. Vehicles tend to have limited processing resources and are energy-constrained. So, any security provision needs to abide by these limitations. At the same time, attacks against vehicles are very rare, often making knowledge-based intrusion detection systems less practical than behaviour-based ones, which is the reverse of what is seen in conventional computing systems. Furthermore, vehicle design and implementation can differ wildly between different types or different manufacturers, which can lead to intrusion detection designs that are vehicle-specific. Equally importantly, vehicles are practically defined by their ability to move, autonomously or not. Movement, as well as other physical manifestations of their operation may allow cyber security breaches to lead to physical damage, but can also be an opportunity for detection. For example, physical sensing can contribute to more accurate or more rapid intrusion detection through observation and analysis of physical manifestations of a security breach. This paper presents a classification and survey of intrusion detection systems designed and evaluated specifically on vehicles and networks of vehicles. Its aim is to help identify existing techniques that can be adopted in the industry, along with their advantages and disadvantages, as well as to identify gaps in the literature, which are attractive and highly meaningful areas of future research.

        Quantum-resistant identity-based signature with message recovery and proxy delegation

        <p>
        Digital signature with proxy delegation, which is a secure ownership enforcement tool, allows an original signer to delegate signature rights to a third party called proxy, so that the proxy can sign messages on behalf of the original signer. Many real-world applications make use of this secure mechanism, e.g., digital property transfer. A traditional digital signature mechanism is required to bind a message and its signature together for verification. This may yield extra cost in bandwidth while the sizes of message and signature are relatively huge. Message recovery signature, enabling to reduce the cost of bandwidth, embeds a message into the corresponding signature; therefore, only the signature will be transmitted to the verifier and the message can further be recovered from the signature. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose a novel digital signature scheme in the identity-based context with proxy delegation and message recovery features and, more importantly, our scheme is quantum resistant, in a particular lattice-based signature. Our scheme achieves delegation information and signature existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen warrant and identity. Compared with the seminal lattice-based message recovery signature, our scheme is independent from public key infrastructure, realizes delegation transfer of signature rights, and compresses signature length ulteriorly. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its type.

        Cyber-insurance as a signaling game: self-reporting and external security audits

        <p>
        An insurer has to know the risks faced by a potential client to accurately determine an insurance premium offer. However, while the potential client might have a good understanding of its own security practices, it may also have an incentive not to disclose them honestly since the resulting information asymmetry could work in its favor. This information asymmetry engenders adverse selection, which can result in unfair premiums and reduced adoption of cyber-insurance. To overcome information asymmetry, insurers often require potential clients to self-report their risks. Still, clients do not have any incentive to perform thorough self-audits or to provide comprehensive reports. As a result, insurers have to complement self-reporting with external security audits to verify the clients’ reports. Since these audits can be very expensive, a key problem faced by insurers is to devise an auditing strategy that deters clients from dishonest reporting using a minimal number of audits. To solve this problem, we model the interactions between a potential client and an insurer as a two-player signaling game. One player represents the client, who knows its actual security-investment level, but may report any level to the insurer. The other player represents the insurer, who knows only the random distribution from which the security level was drawn, but may discover the actual level using an expensive audit. We study the players’ equilibrium strategies and provide numerical illustrations.

        This paper presents a cyber-physical systems modelling language for capturing and describing health-based critical infrastructures. Following this practice incident response plan developers are able to model and reason about security and recovery issues in medical cyber-physical systems from a security requirements engineering perspective. Our work builds upon concepts from the Secure Tropos methodology, where in this paper we introduce novel cyber-physical concepts, relationships and properties in order to carry out analysis of incident response plans based on security requirements. We illustrate our concepts through a case study of a radiological department’s medical cyber-physical systems that have been infected with the WannaCry ransomware. Finally, we discuss how our modelling language enriches security models with incident response concepts, guiding plan developers of health-based critical infrastructures in understanding cyber-physical systems vulnerabilities and support decision making at a tactical and a strategic level, through semi-automated secure recovery analysis

        The advancement of Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge devices with various types of sensors enables us to harness diverse information with Mobile Crowd-Sensing applications (MCS). This highly dynamic setting entails the collection of ubiquitous data traces, originating from sensors carried by people, introducing new information security challenges; one of them being the preservation of data trustworthiness. What is needed in these settings is the timely analysis of these large datasets to produce accurate insights on the correctness of user reports. Existing data mining and other artificial intelligence methods are the most popular to gain hidden insights from IoT data, albeit with many challenges. In this paper, we first model the cyber trustworthiness of MCS reports in the presence of intelligent and colluding adversaries. We then rigorously assess, using real IoT datasets, the effectiveness and accuracy of well-known data mining algorithms when employed towards IoT security and privacy. By taking into account the spatio-temporal changes of the underlying phenomena, we demonstrate how concept drifts can masquerade the existence of attackers and their impact on the accuracy of both the clustering and classification processes. Our initial set of results clearly show that these unsupervised learning algorithms are prone to adversarial infection, thus, magnifying the need for further research in the field by leveraging a mix of advanced machine learning models and mathematical optimization techniques.

        <p>
        When undertaking cybersecurity risk assessments, it is important to be able to assign numeric values to metrics to compute the final expected loss that represents the risk that an organization is exposed to due to cyber threats. Even if risk assessment is motivated by real-world observations and data, there is always a high chance of assigning inaccurate values due to different uncertainties involved (e.g., evolving threat landscape, human errors) and the natural difficulty of quantifying risk. Existing models empower organizations to compute optimal cybersecurity strategies given their financial constraints, i.e., available cybersecurity budget. Further, a general game-theoretic model with uncertain payoffs (probability-distribution-valued payoffs) shows that such uncertainty can be incorporated in the game-theoretic model by allowing payoffs to be random. This paper extends previous work in the field to tackle uncertainties in risk assessment that affect cybersecurity investments. The findings from simulated examples indicate that although uncertainties in cybersecurity risk assessment lead, on average, to different cybersecurity strategies, they do not play a significant role in the final expected loss of the organization when utilising a game-theoretic model and methodology to derive these strategies. The model determines robust defending strategies even when knowledge regarding risk assessment values is not accurate. As a result, it is possible to show that the cybersecurity investments’ tool is capable of providing effective decision support.

        <p>
        Cybersecurity has become a key factor that determines the success or failure of companies that rely on information systems. Therefore, investment in cybersecurity is an important financial and operational decision. Typical information technology investments aim to create value, whereas cybersecurity investments aim to minimize loss incurred by cyber attacks. Admittedly, cybersecurity investment has become an increasingly complex one, since information systems are typically subject to frequent attacks, whose arrival and impact fluctuate stochastically. Furthermore, cybersecurity measures and improvements, such as patches, become available at random points in time making investment decisions even more challenging. We propose and develop an analytical real options framework that incorporates major components relevant to cybersecurity practice, and analyze how optimal cybersecurity investment decisions perform for a private firm. The novelty of this paper is that it provides analytical solutions that lend themselves to intuitive interpretations regarding the effect of timing and cybersecurity risk on investment behavior using real options theory. Such aspects are frequently not implemented within economic models that support policy initiatives. However, if these are not properly understood, security controls will not be properly set resulting in a dynamic inefficiency reflected in cycles of over or under investment, and, in turn, increased cybersecurity risk following corrective policy actions. Results indicate that greater uncertainty over the cost of cybersecurity attacks raises the value of an embedded option to invest in cybersecurity. This increases the incentive to suspend operations temporarily in order to install a cybersecurity patch that will make the firm more resilient to cybersecurity breaches. Similarly, greater likelihood associated with the availability of a cybersecurity patch increases the value of the option to invest in cybersecurity. However, the absence of an embedded investment option increases the incentive to delay the permanent abandonment of the company's operation due to the irreversible nature of the decision.

        The occurrence of congestion has an extremely deleterious impact on the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This article presents a novel protocol, named COALA (COngestion ALleviation and Avoidance), which aims to act both proactively, in order to avoid the creation of congestion in WSNs, and reactively, so as to mitigate the diffusion of upcoming congestion through alternative path routing. Its operation is based on the utilization of an accumulative cost function, which considers both static and dynamic metrics in order to send data through the paths that are less probable to be congested. COALA is validated through simulation tests, which exhibit its ability to achieve remarkable reduction of loss ratios, transmission delays and energy dissipation. Moreover, the appropriate adjustment of the weighting of the accumulative cost function enables the algorithm to adapt to the performance criteria of individual case scenarios.

        Internet of Things (IoT) can be seen as the main driver towards an era of ubiquitous computing. Taking into account the scale of IoT, the number of security issues that emerge are unprecedented, therefore the need for proposing new methodologies for elaborating about security in IoT systems is undoubtedly crucial and this is recognised by both academia and the industry alike. In this work we present Apparatus, a conceptual model for reasoning about security in IoT systems through the lens of Security Requirements Engineering. Apparatus is architecture-oriented and describes an IoT system as a cluster of nodes that share network connections. The information of the system is documented in a textual manner, using Javascript Notation Object (JSON) format, in order to elicit security requirements. To demonstrate its usage the security requirements of a temperature monitor system are identified and a first application of Apparatus is exhibited.

        <p>
        The volume of banking transaction has increased considerably in the recent years with advancement in financial transactions payment methods. Consequently, the number of fraud cases has also increased, causing billion of dollar losses each year worldwide, although from Literature, there has been substantial work in the domain of fraud detection by both the industry and academia's. Despite the substantial work, there are few researches in applying case-based reasoning (CBR) approach in the context of detecting Financial Fraud. In this paper we aim at evaluating the performance of CBR in Identifying fraudulent patterns among financial transaction by comparing it with logistic regression (LR) and neural network (NN) which are often used in many related work. To evaluate our approach simulated data, based on a sample of real anonymous transaction provided by a bank was used and the result shows that LR outperformed NN and CBR model, with a steady increase in precision, sensitivity and specificity as the percentage ratio for the training and test data were varied. This was due to the linearity, fuzziness and presence of uncertainty in the sampling dataset. Therefore, we can reach a conclusion that part of the possible reasons why there are few research in applying CBR to the context of detecting financial fraud patterns may be due to incomplete information, fuzziness and uncertainty in the available data sets used for experimentation.

        Decision support approaches for cyber security investment

        <p>
        When investing in cyber security resources, information security managers have to follow effective decision-making strategies. We refer to this as the cyber security investment challenge. In this paper, we consider three possible decision support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge. We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation, and a hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity threats. As game theory captures the interaction between the endogenous organisation’s and attackers’ decisions, we consider a 2-person control game between the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of a cyber security control, and a commodity attacker who chooses among different targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g. financial) are combined with a Knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a multi-objective multiple choice Knapsack based strategy. To compare these approaches we built a decision support tool and a case study regarding current government guidelines. The endeavour of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security investment. Going a step further in validating our work, we have shown that our decision support tool provides the same advice with the one advocated by the UK government with regard to the requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks in SMEs.

        Game theory meets information security management

        <p>
        This work addresses the challenge “how do we make better security decisions?” and it develops techniques to support human decision making and algorithms which enable well-founded cyber security decisions to be made. In this paper we propose a game theoretic model which optimally allocates cyber security resources such as administrators’ time across different tasks. We first model the interactions between an omnipresent attacker and a team of system administrators seen as the defender, and we have derived the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) in such games. We have formulated general-sum games that represent our cyber security environment, and we have proven that the defender’s Nash strategy is also minimax. This result guarantees that independently from the attacker’s strategy the defender’s solution is optimal. We also propose Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an efficient technique to compute approximate equilibria in our games. By implementing and evaluating a minimax solver with SVD, we have thoroughly investigated the improvement that Nash defense introduces compared to other strategies chosen by common sense decision algorithms. Our key finding is that a particular NE, which we call weighted NE, provides the most effective defense strategy. In order to validate this model we have used real-life statistics from Hackmageddon, the Verizon 2013 Data Breach Investigation report, and the Ponemon report of 2011. We finally compare the game theoretic defense method with a method which implements a stochastic optimization algorithm.

        Performance evaluation of secure video transmission over WIMAX

        <p>
        WiMAX is a wireless digital communication system based on the IEEE 802.16 standard which provides broadband wireless Internet access at very high rates that is up to 70 Mbps or a data rate of about 3 Mbps within a radius of 30-mile (data rate increases as the distance decreases). With the rapid increase in the wireless broadband use, the need for wireless fixed and mobile metropolitan area networks has ever been increasing. Multimedia communications, including audio and video are highly bandwidth demanding and error sensitive. When the coverage area of the wireless network technology is as high as with WiMAX, security becomes one of the most important issues.WiMAX, both mobile and fixed, has many attractive features such as connection-oriented MAC layer, provision of the Quality-of-Service (QoS) for different applications, efficient mobility and power save mode features. Needless to say, all these attractive features must be protected against malicious activities by security mechanisms.Providing secure multimedia communications by using a broadband wireless technology like WiMAXis likely to be challenging due to time or space overhead that occur. Security mechanisms might increase packet sizes thus delay, jitter and throughput are increased. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of secure video transmission over WiMAX networks under different cryptographic algorithms by using the OPNET simulator. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the security extensions giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios.
